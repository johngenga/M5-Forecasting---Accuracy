Completed Steps:
Data Loading:

Loaded sales_train_validation, calendar, and sell_prices datasets.
Data Transformation:

Melted the sales data into a long format.
Merged sales data with calendar and sell_prices datasets.
Feature Engineering:

Created date-related features (day, weekday, month, year).
Created rolling window features for sales data (rolling mean and std for 7 and 30 days).
Handled missing values in event columns and sell_price.
Applied one-hot encoding to categorical features (event types).
Model Training:

Defined a function to train a RandomForest model for each department.
Evaluated the model using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Plotted feature importance.

Key Notes >>>Selection of features.

These features had strong correlation with sales were thus most appropriate for selection to be included in the analysis.
The analysis leading up to this decision can be found in the notes .ref data_exploration.

1. rolling_mean_7
2. rolling_std_7
3. rolling _mean_30
4. rolling _std_30
5. sell_price.
6. wm_yr_wk.
7. wday.

Likely challenges >>> system running out of memory while performing the one-hot encoding.
 Response > We shall abandon One hot encoding for this reason.
